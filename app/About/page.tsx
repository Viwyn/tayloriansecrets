                    About Taylorian Secrets
                </h1>
                <p>
                    Taylorian Secrets is a anonymous blog that focuses on
                    providing students of Taylor&apos;s University, a safe and
                    open place for sharing secrets, stories, and spicy tea üçµ.
                    This started as an instagram account @taylorians_secrets
                    that went unmanaged so as a bored CS student, I figured why
                    not make something for us, the students.
